[work in progress] currently, a 1-dimensional plane-parallel radiative transfer model applicable to ice and snowpack that uses Mie theory for single-scattering and delta-Eddington for two-flux multiple-scattering. The model is mostly functional but figuring out how to use it would be a challenge. I will add documentation and organize stuff soon.
